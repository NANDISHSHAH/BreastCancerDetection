# BreastCancerDetection
Hello guys I have been working on the support vector machine from a time I recently made a project On Breast Cancer Detection.
Where I have used a paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271907638_Breast_Cancer_Detection_with_Reduced_Feature_Set
by AhmetMert,1 NiyaziKJlJÃ§,2 ErdemBilgili,1 andAydinAkan2 .The paper provides a deep idea about what a computational math behind it. 
Machine Learning techniques(SVM)  was able to classify tumors into Malignant/Benign with 97% accuracy
The technique can rapidly evaluate breast masses and classify them in an automated fashion
Early breast cancer detection can dramatically save lives, especially in the developing world.
