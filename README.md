# BreastCancerDetection
Hello guys I have been working on the support vector machine for a adequate amount of time I recently made a project On Breast Cancer Detection.
Where I have used a paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271907638_Breast_Cancer_Detection_with_Reduced_Feature_Set
by AhmetMert,1 NiyaziKJlJç,2 ErdemBilgili,1 andAydinAkan2 .The paper provides a deep idea about what a computational math behind it. 
Machine Learning techniques(SVM)  was able to classify tumors into Malignant/Benign with 97% accuracy
The technique can rapidly evaluate breast masses and classify them in an automated fashion
Early breast cancer detection can dramatically save lives, especially in the developing world.
I have tried a other classifier models for Tp.
I have analyed data using seaborn and matplotlib .
A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or “classifier”) on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows the visualization of the performance of an algorithm.
